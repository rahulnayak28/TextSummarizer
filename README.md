**Why Summarize Texts**

There are a number of valid reasons in favor of the automatic summarization of documents:

-> Summaries reduce reading time

-> When researching documents, summaries make the selection process easier.

-> Automatic summarization algorithms are less biased than human summarizers.

-> Personalized summaries are useful in question-answering systems as they provide personalized information.

-> Besides, a summary enables readers to identify the basic content of a document quickly and accurately, to determine its relevance to their interests, and thus to decide whether they need to read the document in its entirety.
